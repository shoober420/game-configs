-lv: low violence

-vulkan: DXVK REQUIRED

-condebug (creates console log, useful for cvarlist generation)

-threads: Let the engine decide how many threads it spawns, by omitting the threads launch option (Valve confirmed)
 + If threads is not set, the number of threads in the global thread pool is 'number of logical processors - 2', unless that value is larger than 3 (in which case 3 is the number of threads)

-d3dex for HQ D3D

-refreshrate 240 -freq 240 also force refresh rate

-fullscreen may crash with -vulkan, use -windowed -noborder

DXVK can be updated on Windows by swapping old bin/dxvk_d3d9.dll file with new DXVK x32/d3d.dll and matching the original dll name.

DXVK can be updated on Linux by compiling latest git master and swapping files.

DXVK is faster than native Direct3D
