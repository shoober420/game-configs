Realtime Memory Frequency: Disabled
Realtime Memory Timing: Disabled
Fine Granularity Refresh: Enabled (improves performance)
Memory Enhancement Settings: Enhanced Performance
Memory Timing Mode: Fixed
Memory Channel Detection Message: Enabled

Vcore Voltage Mode: Fixed Vcore (Adaptive Vcore causes instability and stuttering)
VF Offset Mode: Selection
CPU Vcore: 1.450V (lower voltage significantly reduces temps)
Internal CPU Vcore: 1.450V
Internal CPU Vcore Offset: -0.075V
VF Point 6-10 Offset (Advanced Voltage Offset): -0.050V
VF Point 11 Offset (Advanced Voltage Offset): Auto

Advanced Voltage Settings > CPU/VRM Settings:
CPU Internal AC/DC Load line: Auto (Performance, Turbo, and Extreme cause overheating and overvoltage, along with CPU degradation)

CPU Vcore Loadline Calibration (LLC): Low (Low preferred, but higher values may be needed for stable OC / NEVER use Turbo, Extreme, or UltraExtreme LLC, causes high temps and high volts, along with CPU degradation)

Internal VR Control:
IA VR Config Enable: Enabled
IA AC Loadline: 1 (0.01 mOHm)
IA DC Loadline: 1 (0.01 mOHm)

Smart Fan 6 [F6]:
Speed Control: Full Speed (keeps water pump running at 100%)
Fan Control Use Temperature Input: CPU
Control Mode: PVM (keeps constant 12V for AIO)
Stop: Disabled
Mode: Slope



Last V/F Point value is manual OC V/F Curve for custom OC ratio

High LLC values Turbo+ / LLC6+ cause microsecond high voltage spikes that monitoring programs don't pick up that exceed Fixed Vcore value, DONT USE

Loadline Calibration (LLC): Gigabyte / ASUS
UltraExtreme = LLC8
Extreme = LLC7
Turbo = LLC6
High = LLC5
Medium = LLC4
Low = LLC3
Standard = LLC2
Normal = LLC1

AIO Installation: Hoses down, Radiator Up (Water pump orientation with hoses pointing down, Radiator above water pump)

NEVER enable E-cores (fixes stuttering)
NEVER overclock E-cores, leave at max turbo clock speeds
