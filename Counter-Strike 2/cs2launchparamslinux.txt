-condebug (creates console log, useful for cvarlist generation)

-windowed -noborder (possibly needed for 4:3 stretched using Vulkan API) (Vulkan has a bug that could force black bars for 4:3 resolutions)

-threads: Let the engine decide how many threads it spawns, by omitting the threads launch option (Valve confirmed)
 + If threads is not set, the number of threads in the global thread pool is 'number of logical processors - 2', unless that value is larger than 3 (in which case 3 is the number of threads)

bind alt "toggle cl_radar_scale 1 0.3; toggle cl_radar_always_centered 1 0" (could trigger kick from server by VACNet)
