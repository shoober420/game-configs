-high lowers FPS

-limitvsconst will limit the game's number of vertex shaders to a maximum of 256

-condebug (creates console log, useful for cvarlist generation)

-windowed -noborder (possibly needed for 4:3 stretched using Vulkan API) (Vulkan has a bug that could force black bars for 4:3 resolutions)

-threads: Let the engine decide how many threads it spawns, by omitting the threads launch option (Valve confirmed)
 + If threads is not set, the number of threads in the global thread pool is 'number of logical processors - 2', unless that value is larger than 3 (in which case 3 is the number of threads)

-refreshrate 240 -freq 240 also force refresh rate

Native Vulkan is faster than native Direct3D (unless possibly NVIDIA Vulkan beta driver has faster Direct3D)
