-condebug (creates console log, useful for cvarlist generation)

-windowed -noborder (possibly needed for 4:3 stretched using Vulkan API) (Vulkan has a bug that could force black bars for 4:3 resolutions)

-threads 24+ cause crashes on 13900kf (32 thread processor)

-refreshrate 240 -freq 240 also force refresh rate

Vulkan is generally faster than D3D
